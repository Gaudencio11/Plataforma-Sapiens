### Features

- It's basically a system where you can add the meeting links of your event. These links will be represented by cards, where you can put an image, a title, a date and a description. Then you can divide the cards by rooms (by different categories). Also you can divide it by days, if your event demands it.

- All the customization said above can be made by the admin of the site, no need to add the information to the code. It's all saved on the database.

- An Authentication system is present

- You can add a noreply email to recovery and activate users accounts.
